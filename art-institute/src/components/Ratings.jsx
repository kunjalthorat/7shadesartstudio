She got to learn so many new techniques of creating a beautiful form of art from Gitanjali ma'am. She is an amazing teacher who really puts her 100% into her work. She gives excellent guidance and at the same time ensures that you do it yourself and that the painting comes out to perfection. She is a very warm and amicable person and its nice to get a chance to learn so much from her. Thank you so much 7 shades art studio!",
